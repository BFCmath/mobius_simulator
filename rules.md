# **Obstacle Course Round**

1. This round will consist of 16 squares numbered from 1 to 16 and an accompanying hidden image related to a term from the main theme of Math - Informatics. This term is the "Obstacle" that the teams must find.
2. These 16 squares cover the image that needs to be guessed. Each square corresponds to a question ranging in difficulty from easy to medium. The squares are arranged as shown in the diagram below:

    [Diagram shows a 4x4 grid with numbers arranged non-sequentially:
    Row 1: 1, 2, 3, 4
    Row 2: 12, 13, 14, 5
    Row 3: 11, 16, 15, 6
    Row 4: 10, 9, 8, 7]

    Among these, squares 1 to 12 correspond to easy questions, with a thinking time of 1 minute. Squares 13 to 16 will be of medium difficulty, with a thinking time of 1 minute 30 seconds.

3. Questions require short answers. Each correct answer for squares 1 to 12 earns 10 points; squares 13 to 16 earn 15 points. Incorrect answers or failure to provide an answer will not result in a point deduction.
4. After correctly answering the question for the selected square, the corresponding image piece (matching the square's number) will be revealed. If the square is not answered correctly, its corresponding image piece will not be revealed.
5. Each square from 13 to 16 contains 1 hint related to the Obstacle to be found. There are 4 hints in total.
6. Each team has a maximum of 4 turns to choose and answer one of the squares, starting with the team in the 1st position (or rank).
7. Teams can attempt to answer the Obstacle at any time. Correctly answering the Obstacle earns points on a sliding scale: 90 points if answered after the 1st square is revealed, 85 points after the 2nd, 80 points after the 3rd, and so on, down to 10 points if answered after all 16 squares are revealed.
8. If all 16 squares are revealed and no team has correctly identified the Obstacle, the organizers will provide one final hint related to the image. Teams will then have 1 minute to think. A correct answer earns 5 points; incorrect answers incur no penalty.
